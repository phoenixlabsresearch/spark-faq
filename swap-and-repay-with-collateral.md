# Swap & Repay with collateral

## Introduction

In Spark Lend you have the ability to swap your deposited assets, even the ones being used as collateral, to another asset. Spark Lend also allows you to repay your debt/loans with your deposited collateral. More information can be found below.

## How do I swap my deposited asset?

In order to swap your assets you just need to go to the Swap section and follow these steps:\
\- Select the asset you want to swap and the amount in the left side (From).\
\- Select the asset you want to swap to in the right side (From)\
\- Make sure to check the swap rate and check the slippage. You can edit it based on your preferences. Depending on the slippage, the expected rate might differ and the transaction might even fail if you set it too low. After this click on Continue.\
\- In the next step you will need to send the approval and submit the transaction. The approval transaction will only be required the 1st time you do this step, unless you revoke the approval.\
\- Make sure to have enough ETH for the transaction cost. After sending both transactions your swap will be complete.
